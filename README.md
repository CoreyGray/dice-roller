dice-roller
===========

HTML5 and native application for iPhone, Android and other mobile
devices to roll dice.

The Story
=========

We were traveling and wanted to play a game with some dice.  That
is wen we found out that we failed to bring any dice.  Our best
plans to play games foiled by forgotten dice.  So... Dice-Roller
was born!   You can select the number of dice to roll.  Fun was had
- and that is the important part!

Future Plans
============

1. Add time stamp to the output.
2. Add a log of previous rolls.
3. Allow for other than 6 sided dice.
4. Build this into a native application for iOS and Android.
